# Haqor Bible study App

Origional language study first Bible software that can be used on all devices - mobile, tablet, and desktop.

## Why the name?

The name is taken from the word חֲקֹר ("search out") from proverbs 25, where it says: 

  > It is the glory of Elohim to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter. (*Prov 25:2*)

This software is for people who are searching out the word of Yahweh for themselves. I am Christian (Christadelphian) and like to spend time studying the bible in it's origional languages.

## Why yet another bible application?

### Origional language study

There are many bible applications that are english language reading first bible applications and focused on reading the bible via the many and varied english translations. The problem is that every translation from one language to another is inevitably part interpretation as one language is not directly equivalent to another.

Often these interpretations are okay and don't realy impact the overall meaning. Other times depth of meaning is lost or hidden, or even adds theological meaning that is not justified from the origional. For example choosing to transliterate (copy over the sounds of the origional words) "Devil" and "Satan", turning them into propper names and attaching new meaning to these new words. Instead of translating (copy over the meaning using equivalent words) with phrases/words such as "false accuser" and "adversary".

These are theological choices and not intrinsic to the origional Hebrew/Greek/Aramaic words. Personally I think these interpretational choices should be more transparent, which is probably one of the biggest benefits of studying in the origional languages directly. My hope is that this software makes it easer to study the bible in it's origional languages.

### Study first

Most bible software currently existing is designed primarily for reading the bible in the english language. They often provide some bolt on tools to access the origional languages, but they feel to me more of a secondary consideration with poor integration. There is less software out there right now (as I write this), aimed primarily at reading and studying the origional language as I study it personally.

At the moment I use a mix of resources because there isn't one single tool that does everything. There are already lots of resources available, from physical books, websites, mobile (android) apps like andbible or logos, up to full desktop applications like bibletime and logos bible software.

All of these resources are invaluble, but one integrated solution across all devices would be far better.
