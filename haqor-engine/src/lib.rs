//! # Haqor Engine
//!
//! A library for interacting with bible resources. Providing low level access
//! to the bible in it's original languages as well as translations. This
//! library is intended to provide the core functionality behind the `Haqor`
//! app, developed in [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) to provide a cross platform GUI.
//!
//! Other options are available for the GUI, an interesting contender is
//! [slint](https://slint.dev). Ideally the GUI would be pure Rust framework.
